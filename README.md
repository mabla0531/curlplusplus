# curl++
## Description
curl++ has the goal of being a minimal but robust HTTP client with an immediate-mode terminal UI.

### Prio 1 (week or so):

- CTRL + Backspace for deleting the remainder of tabbing (i.e. 7 spaces -> delete 3 then 4 spaces)
- a guard against escape quitting the application or some sort of other quitting mechanism (maybe a menu similar to Btop)

### Prio 2:

- of course actual HTTP client functionality

### Prio 3:

- theme engine/framework
- funky animations for request processing
- ability to act as a mock server? via an openapi doc?
