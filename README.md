# curl++
## Description
curl++ has the goal of being a minimal yet functional HTTP client with an immediate-mode terminal UI.

Intentions are to add the following features:
- all HTTP protocols
- vim-style (ish) navigation and input (with a helper footer!)
- full truecolor terminal support
- Kitty graphics protocol support for image MIME types
- cool bars that fly around and do fun stuff
- color-formatted JSON viewer??!??!
- header, URL query, JSON body data methods
- probably a history box for previous routes hit
