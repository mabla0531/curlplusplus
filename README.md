# curl++
## Description
curl++ has the goal of being a minimal but robust HTTP client with an immediate-mode terminal UI.

- a guard against escape quitting the application or some sort of other quitting mechanism (maybe a menu similar to Btop)

### Prio 2:



### Prio 3:

- ability to act as a mock server? via an openapi doc?
